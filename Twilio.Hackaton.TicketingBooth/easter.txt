A story:

Once upon a time, in the middle of nowhere (London), there was a little princess (brightcast.io) living in a perfect world (during a global pandemic). 
Now, the princess happens to be a tech startup, and she stumbled on an adventure (#twiliohackaton). 
Now, our little hero, wasn't meant to be there, but a lost hermit gave her a quest, to retrieve the kingdom crown and save the world from the dark energy (covid).
While walking in the forest all alone (coding at 3am in the park), a tiny forest spirit appeared ( a client ), with a weird riddle,
if the spirit wanna please,
you should check behind the trees,
the email don't want to click it,
on whatsapp i want my ticket
Well then, that's a revelation and our hero a new path discovered. Following a gracious river, many puzzles had to solve and bugs had to fight,
but in the end a tresure chest was opened, and inside, you guess, the source code to the ticket booth she found.
Well, hopefully the king (twilio) will like, this new crown (solution) which saved the world and our little spirit friend.
